# Modern XPosed API Native Hook Demo

Modern XPosed API Native Demo app based on libxposed-api library from LSPosed Team. This has been developed using the below resources & libraries.

Develop XPosed Modules using Modern Xposed API wiki (Native module) : https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed/wiki/Develop-Xposed-Modules-Using-Modern-Xposed-API

Libxposed API: https://github.com/libxposed/api
Libxposed API example: https://github.com/libxposed/example

Libxposed example is in Kotlin, so I have example in Java as well so that developer can use that for their reference.

As the libraries JARs are not available in Maven repository as of now, I have included them in libs folder so that anyone can directly use them. I built API AAR file using GitHub Action and the Helper AAR file manually on my local system.

Enjoy developing cool Xposed modules and hacking :)
